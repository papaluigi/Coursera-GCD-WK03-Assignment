# Coursera-GCD-WK03-Assignment
Repository for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Week 3 Assignment

##What you find in this repo
- Initial zip package provided in the assignment, containing all data sets (named getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip)
- run_analysis.R script which reads and reshape data, and creates a tidy dataset file
- tidy_dataset.txt file which is the result of the above

##How to reproduce the experiment
- As per project assignment, it is assumed that initial zip package is unzipped under UCI HAR Dataset folder in your working directory
- run the run_analysis.R script in RStudio
- a tidy_dataset.txt file is created by the script in your working directory; this file is the same as the one you find in this repo
